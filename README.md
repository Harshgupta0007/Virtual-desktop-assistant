# Virtual-desktop-assistant
Its a desktop assistant made using python programming language. It can open youtube, GitHub etc and perform some basic tasks.
I have used modules like speechRecognition, pyttsx3, os etc. I have provided the wheel file of pyaudio module to install it manually.
Do pull a request if you can modify my assistant or add any new features.
